# Quick Test Instructions

## Critical Fix Applied

I've fixed a **race condition** in CoreDataStack where the persistent store was loading asynchronously but we were trying to save data before it finished loading.

## Changes Made:

1. **CoreDataStack now loads SYNCHRONOUSLY** - waits for the store to fully load before continuing
2. **Added detailed logging** throughout the save/fetch cycle
3. **Ensures parent context is saved** if it exists

## Test Now:

### 1. Clean Build
In Xcode: **⌘+Shift+K** (Product > Clean Build Folder)

### 2. Run the App
**⌘+R** (Product > Run)

### 3. Check Console for Initialization
You should see:
```
🚀 App launching...
📁 App Container: /Users/.../Library/Application Support
🔧 CoreDataStack: Initializing...
💾 CoreData: Store URL: file:///.../GroceryBudgetOptimizer.sqlite
💾 CoreData: Store type: SQLite
✅ CoreData: Persistent store loaded successfully
✅ CoreData: Store location: file:///.../GroceryBudgetOptimizer.sqlite
✅ CoreData: Container fully initialized and ready
```

**KEY**: You should see "✅ Container fully initialized and ready" - this means the store is loaded synchronously.

### 4. Create a Shopping List
- Navigate to Shopping Lists tab
- Create a smart list with budget 111
- Watch console for:
```
🚀 ShoppingListRepository.createShoppingList() called
💾 Attempting to save context...
💾 Context has changes: true
✅ ShoppingListRepository: Context saved successfully
✅ ShoppingListRepository: Saved list '...' with X items to CoreData
✅ ShoppingListRepository: Verified - list exists in CoreData
```

### 5. **CRITICAL TEST** - Restart the App
- **Stop the app** (⌘+. or Stop button)
- **Start the app again** (⌘+R)
- Navigate to Shopping Lists tab

### 6. Check If Lists Load
Watch console for:
```
📱 ShoppingListsViewModel.loadLists() called
🔍 ShoppingListRepository.fetchAllShoppingLists() called
📋 ShoppingListRepository: Fetched 1 shopping lists from CoreData
  - 'Smart List - ...' (ID: xxx, Items: Y)
✅ Loaded 1 shopping lists
```

**If you see "Fetched 1 shopping lists"** → ✅ **FIXED!** Data is persisting!
**If you see "Fetched 0 shopping lists"** → ❌ Still an issue

## What Changed

**BEFORE**: 
- `loadPersistentStores` was asynchronous
- Code could try to save data before store finished loading
- Data might be "saved" to an uninitialized store

**AFTER**:
- Using `DispatchGroup` to wait for store loading to complete
- Store is **guaranteed** to be ready before any saves
- Synchronous initialization ensures reliability

---

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Please share the console output showing:
1. The initialization logs (from app launch)
2. The save logs (when creating list)
3. The fetch logs (after restart)

This will show us exactly what's happening!
