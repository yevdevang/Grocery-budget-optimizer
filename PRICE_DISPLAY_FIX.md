# Price Display Fix - Removed Estimated Prices

## Summary
Removed the `generateEstimatedPrice` function and updated the app to show **actual prices only** from the Open Prices API. When no real price data is available, the price field will be empty/nil, allowing users to enter the actual price manually.

## Changes Made

### 1. ScanProductUseCase.swift
- ✅ Removed `generateEstimatedPrice(for:barcode:)` function completely
- ✅ Updated price handling to return `nil` when no real price is found
- ✅ Changed `priceSource` to `.unavailable` instead of `.estimated`
- ✅ Updated currency symbol from `$` (USD) to `€` (EUR) for real prices

### 2. OpenFoodFactsService.swift
- ✅ Removed `generateEstimatedPrice(for:barcode:)` function completely
- ✅ Set `averagePrice` to `0` for search results (user will enter manually)
- ✅ Updated `fetchPriceWithFallback` to return `0` instead of estimated price

## How It Works Now

### When Scanning a Barcode:
1. **Product info is fetched** from Open Food Facts (name, image, category, etc.)
2. **Price is attempted to be fetched** from Open Prices API
3. **If real price exists:**
   - Price is displayed with currency (e.g., "€3.21")
   - Shows "Based on X price report(s) in EUR"
4. **If NO price data exists:**
   - Price field shows empty (ready for user input)
   - Shows "Price unavailable"
   - User can manually enter the actual store price

## Why This Change?

### Before:
- ❌ Generated random estimated prices (6.50-12.00 ILS for dairy)
- ❌ Same product scanned multiple times got different prices
- ❌ Fake/estimated data confusing for users

### After:
- ✅ Only shows **real** prices from verified sources
- ✅ Same product always shows the same price (or empty if unavailable)
- ✅ User enters actual prices they see in stores
- ✅ More accurate and transparent pricing

## Israeli Products Note

The Open Prices database currently has **zero price records** for Israeli products:

```bash
# Example: Tnuva Milk 3% (barcode: 7290004131074)
curl "https://prices.openfoodfacts.org/api/v1/prices?product_code=7290004131074"
# Result: {"items": [], "total": 0}
```

This means for Israeli products, users will need to:
1. Scan the barcode
2. See product info (name, image, brand)
3. Manually enter the price they see in the store
4. Save the item

## European Products - Example

Products in Europe (France, UK, etc.) DO have price data:

```bash
# Example: Nutella 400g (barcode: 3017620422003)
curl "https://prices.openfoodfacts.org/api/v1/prices?product_code=3017620422003"
# Result: 118 price records, average €3.21
```

For these products, the app will automatically show the real average price!

## Testing

To test the changes:

1. **Scan an Israeli product** (e.g., Tnuva Milk):
   - ✅ Should show product info
   - ✅ Price should be empty (0.00 ₪)
   - ✅ Status: "Price unavailable"
   - ✅ User can enter price manually

2. **Scan a European product** (e.g., Nutella - barcode 3017620422003):
   - ✅ Should show product info
   - ✅ Price should show real value (e.g., "€3.21")
   - ✅ Status: "Based on X price report(s) in EUR"

## Files Modified

1. `Grocery-budget-optimizer/Domain/UseCases/Product/ScanProductUseCase.swift`
2. `Grocery-budget-optimizer/Data/Network/OpenFoodFactsService.swift`

## Next Steps

Build and run the app to verify:
```bash
# Build the project
xcodebuild -project Grocery-budget-optimizer.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Grocery-budget-optimizer \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' \
  build
```

Then test scanning:
- Israeli products → Empty price, manual entry
- European products → Real prices displayed automatically
