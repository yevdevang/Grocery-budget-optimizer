```

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **API Call**: Adds `countries_tags=israel` to filter products
2. **Fetching**: Gets 15 products per category (25 categories)
3. **Filtering**: Only Israeli products are returned by the API
4. **Deduplication**: Removes duplicates based on barcode/name
5. **Organization**: Groups by category and sorts alphabetically
6. **Storage**: Saves to Core Data for offline access

## 🛍️ Expected Israeli Brands

You should see products from Israeli brands like:
- 🥛 **Tnuva** (Dairy)
- 🥛 **Strauss** (Dairy, Desserts)
- 🧃 **Prigat** (Juices)
- 🍫 **Elite** (Chocolate, Snacks)
- 🥤 **Coca-Cola Israel** (Beverages)
- 🍪 **Osem** (Snacks, Pantry)
- 🥖 **Angel Bakeries** (Bread, Bakery)
- And many more Israeli products!

## 📝 Notes

- ⚡ First launch may take 10-15 seconds to fetch all Israeli products
- 🌐 Requires internet connection
- 💾 Products cached locally after first fetch
- 🇮🇱 **Only Israeli products** - no international products
- 📊 Product count may vary based on Open Food Facts database

## 🔄 How to Refresh

To fetch fresh Israeli products:
1. Go to **Items** tab
2. Tap **🗑️ trash icon** (delete all)
3. Close and reopen app
4. Israeli products will be fetched automatically

## 💰 Currency Note

While products are Israeli, the API returns prices in various currencies. The app converts and displays them consistently. For true Israeli pricing:
- Use the **barcode scanner** to get real-time prices
- Manually add Israeli products with NIS (₪) prices

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add shekel (₪) currency support
- [ ] Integrate with Israeli grocery APIs (Shufersal, Rami Levy, etc.)
- [ ] Hebrew product name support
- [ ] Kosher certification filter
- [ ] Israeli store locations
