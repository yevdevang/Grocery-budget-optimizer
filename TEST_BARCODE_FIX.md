# Test Barcode Fix - Direct Sheet Display

## Problem
When selecting a test barcode from the menu, the product detail sheet wasn't showing because:
1. The test barcodes were calling the real API (which doesn't have those products)
2. When the API returned "product not found", it just closed the scanner without showing any sheet

## Solution
Created a separate flow for test products that bypasses the API entirely:

### 1. **BarcodeScannerView** - Added Test Product Callback
```swift
let onTestProductSelected: ((String, String)) -> Void  // (name, barcode)

private func useTestBarcode(_ productName: String, _ barcode: String) {
    onTestProductSelected(productName, barcode)
}
```

### 2. **HomeViewModel** - Added Test Product Handler
```swift
func handleTestProduct(name: String, barcode: String) {
    // Create mock product info
    let mockProduct: ScannedProductInfo = .init(
        barcode: barcode,
        name: name,
        brand: "Test Brand",
        category: "Snacks",
        unit: "piece",
        imageUrl: nil as String?,
        nutritionalInfo: "Test product for development"
    )
    
    // Close scanner first
    showingScanner = false
    
    // Show product detail after brief delay
    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.3) {
        self.scannedProduct = mockProduct
    }
}
```

### 3. **HomeView** - Wired Up Both Callbacks
```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $viewModel.showingScanner) {
    BarcodeScannerView(
        onBarcodeScanned: { barcode in
            viewModel.handleScannedBarcode(barcode)  // Real API call
        },
        onTestProductSelected: { name, barcode in
            viewModel.handleTestProduct(name: name, barcode: barcode)  // Mock data
        }
    )
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Real Barcode Scan:
1. Camera scans barcode
2. Calls `onBarcodeScanned(barcode)`
3. HomeViewModel calls API
4. Shows product if found, or closes if not found

### Test Barcode Selection:
1. User taps test barcode from menu
2. Calls `onTestProductSelected(name, barcode)`
3. HomeViewModel creates mock product immediately
4. Closes scanner
5. Shows product detail sheet with mock data
6. User can add the item to their inventory

## Test Barcodes Available
All 7 Israeli test barcodes now work and show the sheet:
- Bamba - 7290000071718
- Tnuva Cottage Cheese - 7290000066707
- Tara Milk - 7290000068008
- Elite Chocolate - 7290000287706
- Osem Noodles - 7290001380758
- Strauss Yogurt - 7290000044736
- Coca Cola (Israel) - 7290000093307

## Next Steps
Once you've fixed the CodeScanner module issue in Xcode:
1. Clean Build Folder (Shift+Cmd+K)
2. Build the project
3. Test by tapping the "..." button in scanner
4. Select "Test Barcodes"
5. Choose any product
6. The sheet should appear with the product details
7. You can modify quantity and add it to your inventory

## Files Modified
- `BarcodeScannerView.swift` - Added test product callback
- `HomeViewModel.swift` - Added `handleTestProduct()` method
- `HomeView.swift` - Wired up both callbacks
