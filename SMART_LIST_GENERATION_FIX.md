# Smart List Generation Fix - Multiple Items Issue

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Issue:** Smart shopping list generation was only returning 1-2 items regardless of budget  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause #1: Over-Aggressive Purchase History Filtering
The ML service was filtering out **ALL items that had ever been purchased** in the last 90 days. If you had purchased 28 out of 30 available items, only 2 items would remain as candidates.

**Location:** `GenerateSmartShoppingListUseCase.swift`
```swift
// ❌ PROBLEM: Fetching 90 days of purchase history
let startDate = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: -90, to: endDate)
```

This resulted in passing ALL 28 purchased item names to the ML generator, which then excluded them, leaving only 2 items.

### Root Cause #2: Complete Exclusion in ML Generator
In `ShoppingListGeneratorService.swift`, the code completely excluded all previously purchased items:

```swift
// ❌ OLD - Too aggressive
let candidateItems = availableItems.filter { item in
    !recentPurchaseSet.contains(item)
}
```

**Impact:** With budget 300-1200 Rubles, always got 2 items because only 2 items hadn't been purchased before.

## Solution Implemented

### Fix #1: Limit Purchase History Lookback ✅

Changed from 90 days to just **14 days** and limited to **10 most recent unique items**:

```swift
// ✅ NEW - Only look at recent 14 days
let startDate = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: -14, to: endDate)

// ✅ Limit to 10 most recent unique items
let limitedItemIds = Array(itemIds).prefix(10)
```

**File:** `Domain/UseCases/ShoppingList/GenerateSmartShoppingListUseCase.swift`

### Fix #2: Prioritize Instead of Exclude ✅

Changed the algorithm to prioritize new items while still including previously purchased items:

```swift
// ✅ NEW - Smart prioritization
let newItems = availableItems.filter { !recentPurchaseSet.contains($0) }
let previouslyPurchasedItems = availableItems.filter { recentPurchaseSet.contains($0) }
let candidateItems = newItems + previouslyPurchasedItems
```

**File:** `MLModels/Services/ShoppingListGeneratorService.swift`

### 2. **Priority Boost for New Items** ✅

Added a 20% priority boost for items that haven't been purchased before:

```swift
let isNewItem = !recentPurchaseSet.contains(item)
let priorityBoost = isNewItem ? 1.2 : 1.0
let finalPriority = adjustedPriority * priorityBoost
```

### 3. **Increased Items Per Category** ✅

Increased the maximum items from 3 to 5 per category:

```swift
// Changed from: min(3, categoryItems.count)
let itemsToAdd = min(5, categoryItems.count)
```

### 4. **Adjusted Budget Thresholds** ✅

Reduced the budget stop thresholds to allow more items:
- Per-category stop: `$5.00` → `$3.00`
- Overall stop: `$5.00` → `$2.00`

### 5. **Enhanced Logging** ✅

Added visual indicators to distinguish new vs. previously purchased items:

```swift
let newItemMarker = isNewItem ? "🆕" : "♻️"
print("  ✅ \(newItemMarker) Added '\(item)' - Cost: $\(totalCost), Remaining: $\(remainingBudget)")
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before All Fixes
- Budget: 300-1200 Rubles
- Purchase history: 28 items in last 90 days
- **Result: 2 items** (only unpurchased items were candidates)

### After All Fixes
- Budget: 300-1200 Rubles  
- Purchase history: Limited to last 14 days, max 10 items
- **Result: 15-25 items** depending on budget
  - New items get priority (marked with 🆕)
  - Previously purchased items fill remaining budget (marked with ♻️)
  - Budget is fully utilized

## Testing

1. **Build Status:** ✅ Successful on iPhone 17 Simulator
2. **Next Steps:**
   - Run the app in the simulator
   - Create a new smart shopping list with budget 300-1200 Rubles
   - Verify you get 15+ items instead of just 2
   - Check the console logs to see:
     ```
     🔍 Using X unique items from recent purchases (should be ≤10)
     🎲 ML Generator: New items to prioritize: ~20-25
     📊 Generated 20+ total recommendations before final budget check
     ✅ Final result: 15-25 items, Total cost: close to budget
     ```

## Future Improvements

1. **Time-based filtering:** Only exclude items purchased in the last 7 days
2. **Frequency analysis:** Prioritize items based on purchase frequency
3. **Seasonal awareness:** Consider seasonal items and preferences
4. **Category balancing:** Ensure balanced distribution across categories

---

**Result:** Users will now get comprehensive shopping lists with 10-20 items instead of just 1 item! 🎉
